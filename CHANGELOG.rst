`Next version`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a ``label_from_instance`` override to the form fields.
- Removed the limitation that nodes can only be ordered using an integer
  field within their siblings.
- Changed the representation of ``tree_path`` and ``tree_ordering`` used
  on MySQL/MariaDB and sqlite3. Also made it clear that the
  representation isn't part of the public interface of this package.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added an optional argument to ``TreeQuerySet.with_tree_fields()`` to
  allow reverting to a standard queryset (without tree fields).
- Added ``tree_queries.fields.TreeNodeForeignKey``,
  ``tree_queries.forms.TreeNodeChoiceField`` and
  ``tree_queries.forms.TreeNodeMultipleChoiceField`` with node depth
  visualization.
- Dropped Python 3.4 from the CI.
